# Smart-Air-Monitring-System

IoT-based air pollution monitoring systems represent a sophisticated integration of hardware and software. Hardware components, such as sensors to measure pollutants, microcontrollers to process data, and communication modules to transmit information, form the foundation of these systems.The IoT-based air pollution monitoring system provides several benefits over traditional air pollution monitoring systems. It can collect real-time data from multiple locations, which then analyzed to identify the sources of pollution. It helps to take necessary measures to reduce it.

## IoT Monitoring System components:
This project is designed to monitor and analyze air quality using IoT technologies. The system comprises the following key components:

1. Sensors: These are the core elements of the system, used to measure various air quality parameters. Sensors are categorized into:
2. Physical Sensors: Monitor environmental factors like temperature, humidity.
3. Chemical Sensors: Detect air pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.
4. Microcontroller: Acts as the central processing unit of the system, collecting data from sensors, processing it, and transmitting it to the cloud server. Devices such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP32are commonly used      as microcontrollers in such systems.
5. Communication Module: Facilitates data transmission from the microcontroller to a cloud server using wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.

This system enables real-time air quality monitoring and provides a scalable solution for addressing environmental challenges.
